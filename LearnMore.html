	<h1>Working to build a stronger biotech community.</h1>
	<h2><u>We’re looking forward to seeing you!</u></h2>
	<p>For nearly <em>6 years</em> BioBuzz has been hosting the community at monthly networking events and social gatherings.  What makes these events so unique is the casual, social atmosphere and the diverse group of biotech, life sciences, and other professionals who attend.  <mark>There are no lectures or seminars</mark> and there’s no agenda or program; just fun and networking with your peers.  BioBuzz is working to build a stronger community by bringing the biotech workforce out of the offices and labs to culture relationships, instead of cells. By building a <del>stronger</del> social community we will enhance business and <sub>job opportunities</sub> for everyone in the region.</p>
